# Code In Place 2023 - Slides & Code

As an Online Section Leader for [Code in Place](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/) 2023, which involves virtually teaching the "CS106A: Programming Methodologies" course in Python offered by Stanford University to a section of X students, I have created this repository to share my slides and code with students.
